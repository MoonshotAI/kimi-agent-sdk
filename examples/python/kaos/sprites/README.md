# Sprites KAOS Example

Sprites is a cloud sandbox service with persistent environments, so files and setup can be reused across runs.

This example shows how to:
- Connect to an existing Sprite or create one dynamically
- Install `SpritesKaos` with `set_current_kaos(...)`
- Run Kimi Agent tools in the Sprite filesystem/process context

For setup, comparison, and run commands, see `/Users/moonshot/Projects/kimi-agent-sdk/examples/python/kaos/README.md`.
