# E2B KAOS Example

E2B is a cloud sandbox platform for running commands and file operations in remote isolated environments.

This example shows how to:
- Create or connect to an E2B sandbox
- Install `E2BKaos` with `set_current_kaos(...)`
- Run Kimi Agent tools inside the remote E2B environment

For setup, comparison, and run commands, see `/Users/moonshot/Projects/kimi-agent-sdk/examples/python/kaos/README.md`.
