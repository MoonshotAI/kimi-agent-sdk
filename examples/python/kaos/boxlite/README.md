# BoxLite KAOS Example

BoxLite is a local sandbox runtime that lets you run isolated container workloads on your machine.

This example shows how to:
- Create and start a BoxLite box
- Install `BoxliteKaos` with `set_current_kaos(...)`
- Run Kimi Agent tools inside the box filesystem/process environment

For setup, comparison, and run commands, see `/Users/moonshot/Projects/kimi-agent-sdk/examples/python/kaos/README.md`.
